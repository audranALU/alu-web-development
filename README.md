HTML Advanced
📄 Project Overview
This project is part of the ALU Web Development curriculum. It is focused on replicating a web page from a Figma design file using pure HTML. No CSS is applied in this stage — the goal is to build a clean, semantic, and accessible HTML structure that accurately mirrors the designer's layout.

🎯 Objectives
Reproduce the content and structure from a Figma design file using only HTML.
Practice writing semantic HTML elements (<header>, <main>, <section>, <footer>, etc.).
Learn how to interpret visual designs and translate them into structured HTML.
Lay the foundation for future styling using CSS (in upcoming projects).
🧰 Tools Used
Figma (to inspect and interpret the design layout)
Visual Studio Code (or any code editor of your choice)
HTML5
W3C Validator (to ensure clean, valid HTML)
📁 Folder Structure
